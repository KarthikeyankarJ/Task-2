Difference between document and window object:

In web development, both the document and window objects are fundamental components of the browser's environment,
and they serve different purposes within the context of a web page. Let's explore the key differences between the 
document and window objects


Window Object:

The window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the entire web page.
It is the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment, and properties and methods attached to window are 
global and can be accessed without explicitly referencing window.
It encompasses various properties and methods related to the browser window, such as window.innerWidth, window.
innerHeight, and functions like window.alert().

Additionally, global variables declared in the global scope (outside of any function or block) become properties of
the window object.


Document Object:

The document object represents the entire HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It is a property of the window object and provides methods and properties to interact with the content and structure
of the document.
Developers use the document object to manipulate HTML elements, change content, modify styles, and handle events.

The document object also includes methods to query and select elements within the document, such as getElementById(),
getElementsByClassName(), and querySelector().


while the window object represents the browser window and provides global properties and methods, the document object
is a property of the window object that specifically represents the HTML document loaded in the browser. Developers 
use the window object for global properties and functions, and the document object for manipulating and interacting 
with the content of the web page.
